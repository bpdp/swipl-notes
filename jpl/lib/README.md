Un-managed Libraries Placholder
===============================

I do not put any .jar here since it makes this dist fat. You should go to the internet and fetch all .jar needed by this dist:

* jpl-7.2.2. A bit tricky. You should install [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org) first with JDK compilation enabled
  (read the manual). Once compiled, you will get jpl.jar, rename into jpl-7.2.2.jar and move it here.
  Some environment variables should be set, though. See [swipl-env.sh](../swipl-env.sh) file.
